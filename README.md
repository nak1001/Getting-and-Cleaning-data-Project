# Getting-and-Cleaning-data-Project
The run_analysis.R code does the following:
  Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
  Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
  Uses activity names to name the activities in the data set.
  Labels the data set with variable names.
  Creates an independent tidy data set with the averages of each variable for each activity and subject.
